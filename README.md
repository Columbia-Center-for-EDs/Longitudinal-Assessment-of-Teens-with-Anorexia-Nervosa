# Longitudinal Assessment of Neural Circuits in Adolescents with Anorexia Nervosa
This repository contains resources relating to the NIMH funded study entitled "Longitudinal Assessment of Neural Circuits in Adolescents with Anorexia Nervosa" (R01 MH110445, MPI: Joanna Steinglass, MD & Jonathan Posner, MD).

Longitudinal Assessment of Neural Circuits in Adolescents with Anorexia Nervosa is a longitudinal, multimodal MRI study of reward and habit circuits in youth with anorexia nervosa (AN). The study examines neural circuits among individuals with AN who continue with illness compared with those who remit. The study will advance our understanding of the neural mechanisms underlying AN, and clarify the neurodevelopmental course of AN â€“ both of which are critical to developing novel treatment strategies.

Analyses of data collected at baseline are currently being undertaken.

Participants ate a standardized meal at approximately 12 pm and completed the Food Choice Task with fMRI scanning two hours later. The task comprises two rating phases and a choice phase. During the Choice phase on each trial participants indicated their preference for a changing food item relative to a repeated reference item (on the left; see Foerde et al., 2015 for further information about the task). Approximately 90 minutes after the scan session, participants completed a multi-item buffet meal. At 7 pm participants were served a snack-sized portion of one of their food selections in the Food Choice Task (one trial was randomly selected and the choice honoured). Note that the exact timings may have varied but the break between each study phase was consistent across participants.
