# Longitudinal Assessment of Neural Circuits in Adolescents with Anorexia Nervosa
This repository contains resources relating to the NIMH funded study entitled "Longitudinal Assessment of Neural Circuits in Adolescents with Anorexia Nervosa" (R01 MH110445, MPI: Joanna Steinglass, MD & Jonathan Posner, MD).

Longitudinal Assessment of Neural Circuits in Adolescents with Anorexia Nervosa is a longitudinal, multimodal MRI study of reward and habit circuits in youth with anorexia nervosa (AN). The study examines neural circuits among individuals with AN who continue with illness compared with those who remit. The study will advance our understanding of the neural mechanisms underlying AN, and clarify the neurodevelopmental course of AN â€“ both of which are critical to developing novel treatment strategies.

Analyses of data collected at baseline are currently being undertaken.
