# Longitudinal Assessment of Neural Circuits in Adolescents with Anorexia Nervosa
This repository contains resources relating to the NIMH funded study entitled "Longitudinal Assessment of Neural Circuits in Adolescents with Anorexia Nervosa" (R01 MH110445, MPI: Joanna Steinglass, MD & Jonathan Posner, MD).

Longitudinal Assessment of Neural Circuits in Adolescents with Anorexia Nervosa is a longitudinal, multimodal MRI study of reward and habit circuits in youth with anorexia nervosa (AN). The study examines neural circuits among individuals with AN who continue with illness compared with those who remit. The study will advance our understanding of the neural mechanisms underlying AN, and clarify the neurodevelopmental course of AN â€“ both of which are critical to developing novel treatment strategies.

Analyses of data collected at baseline are currently being undertaken.

Figure 2. Study day procedures

Participants ate a standardized meal at approximately 12 pm and completed the Food Choice Task with fMRI scanning two hours later. The task comprises two rating phases and a choice phase. During the Choice phase, on each trial participants indicated their preference for a changing food item relative to a repeated reference item (see Foerde et al., 2015 for further information about the task). Approximately 90 minutes after the scanning session, participants completed a multi-item buffet meal. 

One trial from the Food Choice Task was randomly selected, and a snack-sized portion of the choice on this trial was served to the participant in the evening. For patients recieving inpatient care at the New York State Psychiatric Institute, the task food replaced their evening snack and was served at around 8 pm. Outpatients and healthy control participants (HC) were given their snack to take home after the multi-item meal and instructed to eat it as an evening snack.

Note that the exact timings may have varied but the interval between the Food Choice Task and the multi-item buffet meal was consistent across patients.
